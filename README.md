# About this project

This experiment can be set to the dots task or the squircles task as perceptual decision-making tasks.
This is a "social" version where the participant sees a partner's response and confidence rating after reporting their own. 
This experiment can be set to be a non-strategic version where the participant simply observes the partner's responses, or to a strategic version where the decision reported with higher confidence will be taken as the joint decision based on whose accuracy the participant is rewarded at the end of the experiment. In the strategic version, objective feedback is provided on each trial as well as on average per block.
The experiment can also be set to include information seeking trials, where the participant after making a decision and confidence judgement, does not see a partner's response but instead is asked if they would like to see an easier version of the stimulus again (as a measure of "true" decision confidence). 
Strategic/non-strategic version (line 78), dots/squircles version (line 75) and basic/info-seeking version (line 68) can all be set in index.html
